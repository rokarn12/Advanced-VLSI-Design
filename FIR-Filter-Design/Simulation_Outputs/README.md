### Images in this folder are screenshots of ModelSim results for the 5 cases

Many of the simulation outputs indicated "Indeterminate Number" as the output which is clearly not the desired output. This most likely has to do with some bug in the implementation of the FIR filter modules. However, the modules could not be successfully debugged before the project deadline.

The other numbers that were outputted properly seem to be behaving as expected, which is a good sign for the correctness of the implementation.
